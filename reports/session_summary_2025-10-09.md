# Session Summary: 2025-10-09

This document summarizes the key accomplishments from our session on October 9, 2025.

### 1. Deep Dive Visualization

*   **Interaction Analysis**: Created new visualizations to analyze the complex interactions between `lighting`, `time_of_day`, `school_season`, and `holiday` on accident risk.
*   **Focused Insights**: Drilled down into specific high-risk scenarios, such as "bright evening" conditions, to better understand the contributing factors.

### 2. Feature Engineering

*   **Plan Update**: Updated the feature engineering plan in `data/README.md` to include a new interaction feature: `holiday_x_time_of_day_x_bright`.
*   **Implementation**: Implemented all the new features defined in the plan in `src/features/build_features.py`, creating a richer dataset for modeling.

### 3. Model Training and Tuning

*   **Baseline Training**: Trained a suite of baseline models on the newly engineered features and logged their performance.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed extensive hyperparameter tuning (50 trials each) for the top three models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) using Optuna.
*   **Tuning Results**: Logged the results of the tuning, identifying the best performing model and its optimal hyperparameters. XGBoost emerged as the top model with an RMSE of 0.0768.
