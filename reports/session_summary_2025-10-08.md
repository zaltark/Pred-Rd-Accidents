# Session Summary: 2025-10-08

This document summarizes the key accomplishments from our session on October 8, 2025.

### 1. Project Initialization & Setup

*   **Git Repository**: Initialized the local git repository and successfully pushed the initial project files to the public GitHub repository.
*   **Project Structure**: Established a robust, scalable MLOps project structure with dedicated directories for `data`, `src`, `reports`, `models`, and `tests`.
*   **Configuration**: Created a centralized configuration file (`config/config.py`) and a `logs` directory to prepare for a formal logging implementation.

### 2. Comprehensive Data Exploration (EDA)

*   **Initial Analysis**: Conducted an initial analysis of the dataset, confirming its size, data types, and the absence of missing values.
*   **Visualization Pipeline**: Built a repeatable visualization pipeline (`src/visualization/visualize.py`) to generate and save plots for all features.
*   **HTML Reporting**: Created a main HTML report (`reports/eda_report.html`) to present all visualizations in a categorized and easy-to-navigate format, linking to deeper analyses.

### 3. Deep-Dive Analyses

*   **Road Signs**: Performed a detailed analysis of the `road_signs_present` feature, concluding it has a weak independent signal. This was documented in its own report (`deep_dive_road_signs.html`).
*   **Temporal Features**: Analyzed the complex interaction between `time_of_day`, `holiday`, and `school_season`, uncovering significant, time-dependent patterns in accident risk. This was also documented in a dedicated report (`deep_dive_temporal.html`).

### 4. Iterative Documentation

*   Throughout the session, we continuously updated the `data/README.md` file with our key findings and our evolving plan for feature engineering. This leaves us with a clear, data-driven strategy for the next steps.
