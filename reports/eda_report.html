        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Accident Risk Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/accident_risk_distribution.png" alt="Accident Risk Distribution">
            <p>This histogram shows the distribution of our target variable, `accident_risk`. It appears to be somewhat skewed, which might influence our choice of model or evaluation strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Curvature Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/curvature_distribution.png" alt="Curvature Distribution">
            <p>This plot shows the distribution of road curvature. Understanding the spread of this variable is important for identifying if certain road curvatures are more common in the dataset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Holiday Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/holiday_distribution.png" alt="Holiday Distribution">
            <p>This bar chart shows the balance between holidays and non-holidays. As expected, the vast majority of the data points are not on holidays.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Lighting Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/lighting_distribution.png" alt="Lighting Distribution">
            <p>This plot shows the distribution of lighting conditions. This will be a key feature to explore in relation to accident risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Number of Lanes Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/num_lanes_distribution.png" alt="Number of Lanes Distribution">
            <p>This histogram shows the distribution of the number of lanes. We can see which lane counts are most common in the dataset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Number of Reported Accidents Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/num_reported_accidents_distribution.png" alt="Number of Reported Accidents Distribution">
            <p>This plot shows the distribution of previously reported accidents. It seems that most road segments have a low number of previously reported accidents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Public Road Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/public_road_distribution.png" alt="Public Road Distribution">
            <p>This chart shows the balance between public and private roads. The majority of roads in the dataset are public.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Road Signs Present Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/road_signs_present_distribution.png" alt="Road Signs Present Distribution">
            <p>This chart shows the balance between roads with and without signs. This is another important feature for our model.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Road Type Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/road_type_distribution.png" alt="Road Type Distribution">
            <p>This bar chart shows the frequency of each road type. This helps us understand the balance of different road types in the data.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>School Season Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/school_season_distribution.png" alt="School Season Distribution">
            <p>This chart shows the balance between school season and non-school season data points.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Speed Limit Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/speed_limit_distribution.png" alt="Speed Limit Distribution">
            <p>This histogram shows the distribution of speed limits. We can see the common speed limits in the dataset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Time of Day Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/time_of_day_distribution.png" alt="Time of Day Distribution">
            <p>This bar chart shows the frequency of different times of day. This will be a crucial feature for understanding accident risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plot">
            <h2>Weather Distribution</h2>
            <img src="figures/weather_distribution.png" alt="Weather Distribution">
            <p>This bar chart shows the frequency of different weather conditions. As expected, clear weather is the most common condition.</p>
