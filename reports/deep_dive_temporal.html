                <p>This plot compares the mean accident risk throughout the day for holidays vs. non-holidays. We can look for differences in the daily pattern. For example, is the morning peak in accident risk (if any) different on holidays when there is no morning commute?</p>

                <p>This plot compares the mean accident risk throughout the day for school season vs. non-school season. We can look for differences in the daily pattern, especially during morning and afternoon times, which correspond to school-related traffic.</p>
