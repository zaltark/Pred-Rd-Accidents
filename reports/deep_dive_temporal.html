                <p>This plot shows the actual unique categories and their counts present in the `lighting` column. It serves to verify which categories exist in the data, for comparison with the `time_of_day` feature.</p>

                <p>This plot directly compares the `time_of_day` and `lighting` features. It shows the distribution of lighting conditions that occur within each time of day bucket. For example, it clearly shows that the 'Evening' time of day contains both 'Dusk' and 'Night' lighting conditions.</p>

                <p>This plot compares the mean accident risk throughout the day for holidays vs. non-holidays. The "crossing lines" show how the risk pattern changes. A tighter y-axis has been used to emphasize the differences.</p>

                <p>This plot compares the mean accident risk throughout the day for school season vs. non-school season. The "crossing lines" clearly show the interaction: risk is lower on school mornings but higher on school afternoons. A tighter y-axis has been used to emphasize these differences.</p>
