            <h1>Deep Dive: Environmental Factors and Accident Risk</h1>
            <p>This report explores the interactions between environmental factors like lighting and weather, and their combined effect on accident risk.</p>
    
        <div class="plot">
            <h3>Lighting Conditions by Time of Day</h3>
            <img src="figures\lighting_vs_time_of_day.png" alt="Lighting Conditions by Time of Day">
            <p>This plot confirms the expected relationship between lighting and time of day. "Night" occurs only at night, "Daylight" mostly during the day. "Dawn" and "Dusk" appear at the appropriate times. This gives us confidence in the data's consistency.</p>

            <h3>Accident Risk vs. Weather by Lighting Condition</h3>
            <img src="figures\risk_vs_weather_by_lighting.png" alt="Accident Risk vs. Weather by Lighting Condition">
            <p>This is a key insight. The impact of weather is highly dependent on lighting. Rainy and Foggy conditions at Night lead to a dramatic increase in accident risk compared to the same conditions during Daylight. This strongly supports creating an interaction feature.</p>

            <h3>Accident Risk vs. Lighting by Road Type</h3>
            <img src="figures\risk_vs_lighting_by_road_type.png" alt="Accident Risk vs. Lighting by Road Type">
            <p>The increase in accident risk at Night is present across all road types, but it is most pronounced on Highways. This suggests that the combination of high speed and low visibility is particularly dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Accident Risk Distribution in Clear Weather (Faceted)</h3>
            <img src="figures\clear_weather_risk_dist_faceted.png" alt="Accident Risk Distribution in Clear Weather (Faceted)">
            <p>This plot shows the distribution of accident risk specifically when weather is 'Clear', faceted by `road_type` and `time_of_day`. It helps identify if risk patterns vary even in good weather conditions.</p>

            <p>This plot shows how the mean accident risk changes with the number of lanes, faceted by road type, specifically when weather is 'Clear'. It highlights interactions that persist even in good weather.</p>

            <p>This heatmap shows the mean accident risk for combinations of `road_type` and `time_of_day`, specifically when weather is 'Clear'. Darker cells indicate higher risk, helping to pinpoint specific high-risk contexts even in good weather.</p>

            <p>This plot shows how the mean accident risk changes with the number of previously reported accidents, faceted by weather condition. It helps identify if the impact of historical accident data varies with weather.</p>
